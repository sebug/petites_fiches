# Petites Fiches RÃ©seau
The goal of this project is to place the information present in a full radio
plan in such a way that it's easy to carry.

This project uses SheetJS https://github.com/sheetjs/js-xlsx

Ideally deployed locally so that we can access it even when Internet is out (to see: external dependencies).
